# Letter substuition to crack encoded message 9 Nov 19

#object: change letter to letter 2 places further along in alphabet. For example,
# a in encoded string becomes c in uncoded string
# b in encoded string becomes d in uncoded string
# c in encoded string becomes e in uncoded string
# ....etc...
# uncoded: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
# encoded: y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x

# The program will translate a coded string into a readable sentence.
# g jmtc nwrfml = i love python
